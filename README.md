# AI-Driven Movie Matchmaking System

## Problem Statement
Users are often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of movie choices available and find current recommendation systems inadequate in surfacing truly relevant and enjoyable content. This disconnect stems from a lack of deep personalization that considers the multifaceted nature of individual preferences and viewing habits. The problem is to bridge this gap by developing an AI-driven matchmaking system that can accurately and intuitively connect users with movies they will love, enhancing their entertainment experience and fostering a stronger sense of discovery.

## Abstract
The challenge of effectively recommending movies that truly resonate with individual user tastes persists despite the prevalence of existing recommendation systems. This abstract presents an AI-driven matchmaking system as a solution, addressing the limitations of conventional approaches by employing advanced machine learning to analyse complex user-movie relationships. The proposed system constructs personalized profiles that capture evolving preferences and contextual factors, enabling the delivery of more accurate, relevant, and serendipitous movie recommendations. This paper will detail the methodology be...

## Deployment

Gradio + Hugging Face Spaces: Best for quick AI model hosting with minimal setup. Users can test different matchmaking parameters via sliders or text input.
Flask API on Render/Deta: If your recommendation system requires backend API integration, Flask can help serve recommendations via endpoints.

Ensure your deployment steps include:
* **Method Used:** Specify whether you used Streamlit, Flask, or Gradio.
* **Public Link:** Provide the hosted model/app link for access.
* **UI Screenshot:** Show how users interact with the system.
* **Sample Prediction Output:** Display example matches and movie suggestions based on user inputs.
